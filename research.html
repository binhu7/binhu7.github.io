<h1>Research <br /></h1>
</div>
<p> I am interested
in building fundamental connections between the techniques used in the control and machine learning
communities.   Specifically, my current research focuses on developing new analysis/design/validation tools that ensure an efficient and safe integration of control
and learning techniques for next generation intelligent systems such as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, and smart buildings. </p>

<h2>System/Control Tools for Certifiable Robustness of Deep Neural Networks and Large Foundation Models </h2>
<p>Deep learning techniques have been used to achieve the state-of-the-art performance for a variety of applications (computer vision, natural language processing, and Go). 
However, the robustness properties of deep learning models have not been fully understood.
This research focuses on tailoring various system/control tools for inducing strong robustness guarantees on deep neural networks and large foundation models. I am currently investigating how to train large-scale Lipschitz neural networks with certified robustness guarantees through the lens of robust control.
  </p>

<h2>Generative AI for Decision-Making and Control in Complex Environments </h2>
<p>Generative AI techniques such as diffusion and large language models have the potential to improve decision-making and control in complex environments.  I am currently studying how to design trustworthy autonomous agents via integrating generative AI and conventional control methods with theoretic guarantees in terms of stability, safety, and robustness.
  </p>


  
<h2>Combining Robust Control and Deep Reinforcement Learning for Safety-Critical AI</h2>
<p>I am interested in reconciling robust control with deep reinforcement learning for safety-critical AI applications. I
am currently investigating the convergence properties of model-free policy gradient methods for various standard robust
control tasks. I am also developing new robust reinforcement learning methods by leveraging ideas from robust control and risk sensitive control.
Finally, I am working on tools and principles for designing perception-based control systems with robustness guarantees.  </p>


<h2>Optimization is Control</h2>
<p> Optimization can be viewed as a control problem. By viewing the gradient of the cost function
as a plant one wants to control, the optimization problem becomes an output regulation control problem.
Consequently, first-order optimization methods can be viewed as controllers regulating the plant. For example, gradient descent,
Nesterov’s method, and heavy-ball method can all be viewed as special cases of the proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) controllers. My current research focus is on translating “controllers” into “optimization
methods” for large-scale unconstrained and constrained optimization problems in machine learning, control, robotics, smart buildings, and power systems.</p>
