<h1>Homework <br /></h1>
</div>

<p>There are roughly biweekly homework assignments. Use entry code <b>N8BJ24</b> to add the course on <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/357787">Gradescope</a> where you will be submitting assignments.
  Best practice is to use your Illinois e-mail ID to make an account.
  Collaboration on the homework is permitted, however each student must write and submit independent solutions. 
  Extensions will be granted with instructor approval in
advance. Otherwise late homeworks without such prior approval will not be accepted.</p>
  
  <p>Read about how to submit assignments on Gradescope <a href="https://help.gradescope.com/article/ccbpppziu9-student-submit-work#variable_length_submissions">here</a>. Make sure your written work is legible. If TAs cannot read your work, they cannot grade it. They may ask you to resubmit or dock points off.
  Do upload high quality PDF scans; most modern smartphones have a document scanning functionality. Make sure to use the tools in Gradescope to mark where in your upload the answer to each question can be found.
  One good practice is to start each question on a new page. For a multi-page answer, associate all relevant pages with the question.</p>
